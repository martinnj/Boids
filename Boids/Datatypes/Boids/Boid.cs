     * A boid is a bird like creature that behavs based on three rules:
     * 0. Coherence - Wants to stay with other boids of the same type.
     * 1. Alignment - Wants to fly the same direction as it's flock.
     * 2. Seperation - Tries not to collide with other boids.
     * 
     * This boids model will, when finished, be slightly different in the aspect that boids
     * will have a "predation level" implementing a simple food-chain where boids can and will
     * hunt everything
